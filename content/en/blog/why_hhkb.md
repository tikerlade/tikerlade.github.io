This story begins with my willingness to improve things around me. Which led me to mastering tools I use as a Machine Learning Engineer on a daily basis. The idea is simple: select a fixed set of tools you use and become extremely skilled in using it.

Tools themselves:
* VS Code + Vim plugin
* Firefox
* zsh + tmux

These tools use shortcuts. For tmux its Ctrl-B + ...

Vim actually not use arrows :)

And Ctrl+Backspace / Ctrl+S / Ctrl+A

CONTROLL!!!

## Asset
I believe that such a keyboard actually is an asset. It didn't lose 30% of its value when I opened it, because it's HHKB: quality & durability.

There is also one good post I could mention: [Buy well. Buy once.](https://fellow.ventures/buy-well-buy-once/)

## Why do I actually need a new keyboard?
I don't have a clear answer to this question.
* I wanted a keyboard which I will know in a nutshell, any system / PC - one keyboard!
* I liked the feel of typing on it (I was lucky to try it before)
* Sound of it is creamy and thock together, I love it
* Layout - Control + 60% keyboard
* Style, color is something retro cool
* It's geeky/nerdy

## The road home (to me)
* 05.09 -- order on amazon (thanks to Egor)
