I started this page due to several reasons.

## CV
In a CV/Resume we ought to write shortly with pure numbers, without our feelings behind a thing. 
However sometimes I would like to list more details about the project / achivement, list something that changed / improved me. And some of the things cannot be added into Resume, because we have limits or achievement is not relevant, but I don't want to forget about any of them.

## Blog
While working on a problem from time to time I find beauty (as I think) or optimization steps which I would like to record here. So that I could return back to it, and see what was done.

## Writing
I heard several times that writing is good for you. I will try to write about something at least once in a week, it sems feasible. Let's practice it, and see how it'll go.

## Personal Brand
This point is highly related to `Blog` one. You either need extraordinary achievements that will speak for themselves, or you need to tell about your medium achievements by yourself, so that someone could know about it.

So, that's it, welcome :)
