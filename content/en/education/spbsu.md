Officially I was accepted into Masters degree at Saint-Petersburg State University, Faculty of Mathematics & Computer Science in August 2022. I passed exams into several other Masters programs:
* SPbSU [SD+DS](https://sdds.compscicenter.ru)
* ITMO SE
* ITMO ML
* HSE (SPb) ML
* SPbPU

However, MCS looked the most promising and the most inspiring. Later I noticed that during my education I could take courses from YSDA. And also, that I was in top-30% of accepted students, which meant that I got special scholarschip from VK.

## :memo: Entrance exam
To get into this masters program I've required to pass the following exam: [link](https://math-cs.spbu.ru/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Variant-1.pdf). It was not very hard, but it was challenging. _One day I will write it down (and it's solution) with LaTeX._

## :crazy_head: Extracurricular Activities
During my 2 Master years at the university I tried to do things not only related to study. Here are several things I completed:
1. [ML Models finetuning](https://joinmkn.ru/summer_school_2023) (Pupils 2023 Summer School)
2. [Yandex Professor Assistance](https://academy.yandex.ru/teaching-assistants#winners) (Fall 2023 - 2024)
3. _To be continued_

## :scroll: Thesis
I didn't decide which Thesis I will write.
