Officially I was accepted into Masters degree at Saint-Petersburg State University, Faculty of Mathematics & Computer Science in August 2022. I passed exams into several other Masters programs:
* SPbSU [SD+DS](https://sdds.compscicenter.ru)
* ITMO SE
* ITMO ML
* HSE (SPb) ML
* SPbPU

However, MCS looked the most promising and the most inspiring. Later I noticed that during my education I could take courses from YSDA. And also, that I was in top-30% of accepted students, which meant that I got special scholarschip from VK.

## Entrance exam
To get into this masters program I've required to pass the following exam: [link](https://math-cs.spbu.ru/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Variant-1.pdf). It was not very hard, but it was challenging.
