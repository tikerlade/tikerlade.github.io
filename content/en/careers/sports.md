The full name of organization I was working at is:

```
САНКТ-ПЕТЕРБУРГСКОЕ ГОСУДАРСТВЕННОЕ БЮДЖЕТНОЕ УЧРЕЖДЕНИЕ
СПОРТИВНАЯ ШКОЛА ОЛИМПИЙСКОГО РЕЗЕРВА ПО КОННОМУ СПОРТУ И СОВРЕМЕННОМУ ПЯТИБОРЬЮ
```

It was kind of a scholarship, but it could be granted only if you scored at least once in Top-3 on a National championship (or better on an International one: European / World). Mine was granted to me due to my January & March 2016 achievements (2 x Silver).

_Even it was a scholarship (I didn't need to do anything extra, just continue training) I list it in Career section because I have a record in my Employment history about it._
