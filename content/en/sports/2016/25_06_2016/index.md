## Results
Individual: `Top-9/35`

Relay Mix: `Top-2/9`

## Story
It was my first competition of that level. There were fellows from Argentina, that was crazy. I supposed to show good results, so that in an upcoming European Championship I could also compete in an individual competitions (otherwise by rating I wouldn't be allowed).

My recent trauma (more than 1 month of laying down in bed in hospital) showed up. I didn't fully recovered and so, results was not my best and I missed an oportunity of competing as individual in United Kingdom, 2 months later.

Anyway, medal (or actally a cup) I received there, thanks to Sasha Valaeva and our joint efforts as a team :)
