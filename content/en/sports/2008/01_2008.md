I am not sure in which date this event happened, but it was in January 2008.

These were family competitions, where my dad and mom and I were a team. We performed various competitions and competed with other families. Then we took first place as a team, got a cake and a medal. This was our first joint participation and we took first place (although there were about 8-10 competitors, but it doesn’t matter), after which for the next 6-7 years we consistently participated in other such competitions (orienteering, athletics, city sports, swimming, skiing, quick starts, table tennis).
