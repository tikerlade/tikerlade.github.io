# My personal page

## Log
Here I will list how I developed the page (so I could reimplement it again if requried).
I was inspired by [Lil'Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/) blog and decided to use the same theme.

### Installations
1. Hugo installation by the following [tutorial](https://gohugo.io/installation/);
2. Add `PageMod` theme using [this](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-installation/) tutorial;
